### üëã Hi there	
_______________________________________________________________________
I'm Wesley Ferrage, a passionate software developer and technology enthusiast. With more than 5 years of experience in logistics, in 2021 I made a fundamental decision to transition my career to the world of programming, driven by a growing interest in technology.

I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, I currently work as a ServiceNow developer at Deloitte, where I had the opportunity to work on projects and explore various features of the ServiceNow platform. This journey has been incredibly rewarding and I am dedicated to continued learning and growth.
